## Development Notes

The frontend is written in [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) with [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) for state management and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety and documentation. The application server back end -- for data processing -- is written in [Go](https://golang.org/).

To build the application, you need to install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and run the following commands:
```
# install dependencies and
#   compile .scss files to .css:
yarn

# Run unit tests in watch mode
yarn test

# Run unit tests with a code coverage report
yarn test:coverage

# start the app running in the
#   webpack development server:
yarn start

# start the app running in https mode
#   (needed for browser geolocation):
yarn start:https

# build the app into build folder
#  for server deployment:
yarn build

# any updates to .scss files need
#  to be compiled to css using:
yarn clean-build-css
```

Using `yarn add` to add new dependencies
will throw an error related to node-sass-chokidar, which can be ignored.

For the best development experience, you should install both the React and Redux Development Tools extensions into your browser. Both browser extensions are available for Chrome and Firefox.

### Unit testing
Unit testing in this repository is done using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) with [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) in addition to the [redux-mock-store](https://github.com/arnaudbenard/redux-mock-store) library to support Redux-related tests.

### End-to-end Integration Tests
E2E testing for this project is done using [TestCafe](https://testcafe.devexpress.com/) with [testcafe-react-selectors](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe-react-selectors). This provides a web scraping test bed that provides an assertion library to ensure that the expected elements appear on each page under test. 

#### Running the tests
Before running the tests, the development server must be running using the command
`yarn start`
Once the test server is running, you may either run all the tests on your local browser using one of the following commands
```
testcafe <browsername> web-tests/*.ts
yarn web-tests:all
```
Or if you have access to browserstack, you may run on multiple browsers using the command

`yarn web-tests:browserstack`

#### Running on browserstack
To run on browserstack, ensure that you have environment variables set for BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY and BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME to the values of your browserstack account
You may view test results on the [dashboard](https://automate.browserstack.com/builds)

#### Debugging and running individual tests
You may run specific tests by running testcafe with the -t or -T option
-t <full test name>
-T <partial test name, must meet grep search criteria. Ex. Tests that start with donate may be found with "Donate.*">

Tests may be run in debug mode with the --inspect-brk option. 
```
testcafe --inspect-brk chrome web-tests/test.ts 
```
Breakpoints may be put in the test with the following syntax
```
// tslint:disable-next-line:no-debugger
debugger;
```
Then in chrome, navigate to `chrome://inspect`
On this page, under Remote Target there will be an inspect link, click to start the debugger.

## Architecture, Data Flow and Strong Typing
A selection of files in this repository include code comments describing the architecture, data flow and strong typing conventions used in developing the React-Redux-TypeScript version of the 5 Calls application. These include files that illustrate the following (see the individual files for more details):

### Use of TypeScript to Strongly Type Request Parameters Passed by React-Router
Also illustrates the use of Redux to loosely couple a component to data passed to its props.<br/>
[CallPageContainer.tsx](https://github.com/5calls/react-dev/blob/master/src/components/call/CallPageContainer.tsx)<br/>
[CallPage.tsx](https://github.com/5calls/react-dev/blob/master/src/components/call/CallPage.tsx)<br/>

### Data Flow through a Component Heirarcy
Also note the TypeScript conventions used in these files.<br/>
[CallPageContainer.tsx](https://github.com/5calls/react-dev/blob/master/src/components/call/CallPageContainer.tsx)<br/>
[CallPage.tsx](https://github.com/5calls/react-dev/blob/master/src/components/call/CallPage.tsx)<br/>
[Why5calls.tsx](https://github.com/5calls/react-dev/blob/master/src/components/call/Call.tsx)<br/>

### Redux Data Flow

See code comments containing the token 'REDUX DATA FLOW'. Also note the use of TypeScript in these files.<br/>
[CallPageContainer.tsx](https://github.com/5calls/react-dev/blob/master/src/components/call/CallPageContainer.tsx)<br/>
[redux/callState/action.ts](https://github.com/5calls/react-dev/blob/master/src/redux/callState/action.ts)<br/>
[redux/callState/actionCreator.ts](https://github.com/5calls/react-dev/blob/master/src/redux/callState/actionCreator.ts)<br/>

## Create React App Code Generation

This project was created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) (CRA, react-scripts ver 1.0.0) using [react-scripts-ts](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript) (ver 2.2.0) to add TypeScript support. In addition, the `node-sass-chokidar` library was added for preprocessing of SASS (.scss files) to CSS.

Subsequently, the CRA-created configurations were exposed using the eject command (`yarn eject`). This created the `config` and `scripts` folders and added dependencies and other configurations to `package.json`.

[CRA_README.md](CRA_README.md) is the original README.md file created when the create-react-app command was run.
